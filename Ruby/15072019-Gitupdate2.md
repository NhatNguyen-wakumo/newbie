## What is Git tag?
```
- A Git tag is used to label and mark a specific commit in the history. Tags are commonly used to indicate release versions, with the release name being the name of the tag.
- There are 2 types of Git:
 + Lightweight tag
 + Annotated tag
```
## Why do we need to use tag?
```
- Git tags are like milestones, markers or a specific point in the repo’s history marked as significant. Tags are usually used to mark stable releases or achievement of very important milestones.

- Tags can help the users of the repo to easily navigate to the important parts of the code history like release points. For example, on Github, you can easily grab archive of “tags” in the current repo.

## How to use tag?
### Creating a tag
#### Add a lightweight tag
_Use the tag command to add a new tag. Enter a tag name in <tagname>._
```
$ git tag <tagname>
```
_Run the following command to add a tag named "watermelon" to HEAD._
```
$ git tag watermelon
```
_To see the history log with tag information, executing "log" with the --decorate option._
```
$ git log --decorate
commit 
```
#### Add an annotated tag
_We can add an annotated tag by running "tag" with the -a option, which opens the default text editor that lets you add notes to the tag._
```
$ git tag -a <tagname>
```
_To add a tag for HEAD named "banana" with some notes._
```
$ git tag -am "Git Beginner's Guide for Dummies" banana
```
### Tagging Later
```
$ git log --pretty=oneline
```
### Deleting Tags
```
$ git tag -d v1.4-lw
Deleted tag 'v1.4-lw'
```
```
$ git push origin --delete <tagname>
```
### Checking out Tags
```
$ git checkout 2.0.0
```
