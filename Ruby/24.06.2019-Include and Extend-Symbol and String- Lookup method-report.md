## symbol and string, the difference
### String
```
String is a list of character in specific sequence. It can be surrounded by single quote or double quote.
```
### symbol
```
Symbol is created by the colon (:) before a word
```
### The difference
```
The value of string can be mutated but the symbol can not.
```
### The conversion between symbol and string
```
"apple".to_sym
=> :apple
:apple.to_s
=> "apple"
```

## include and extend 
```
_extend - adds the specified module's methods and constants to the target's metaclass.  
_extend is the public method.
```
```
_include - it mixes in the specified module's methods as instance methods in the target module/class. 
```
### Example: 
```
module ReusableModule
def module_method
puts "Module Method: Hi there!"
end
end

class ClassThatIncludes
include ReusableModule
end
class ClassThatExtends
extend ReusableModule
end

puts "Include"
ClassThatIncludes.new.module_method       # "Module Method: Hi there!"
puts "Extend"
ClassThatExtends.module_method            # "Module Method: Hi there!"
```
