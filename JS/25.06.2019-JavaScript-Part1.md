## var, let and const, the difference:
_var_ 
```
- is used to declare a variable, initialize it to value.
- It is globally scoped when a var variable is declared outside a function.
- Var can be updated and re-declared.
- Var hoisting can be used when function is declared first and the variable is after.
```
_let_
```
- Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
- Let is the block scoped that are bounded in curly bracket {...}.
- Let can be updated but not re-declared.
- With var, the variable can be initialized but Let can not be initialized 
```
_const_
```
- Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
- const can not be updated or re-declared.
- const can be decleared a hoist but can not be an initialized.
