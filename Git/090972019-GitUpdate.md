## Merge and Rebase, the difference
### Git Merge

#### Definition

_Merging is a common practice for developers using version control systems. Whether branches are created for testing, bug fixes, or other reasons, merging commits changes to another location. merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch. only the target branch is changed. The source branch history remains the same._

#### How to use
```
$ git checkout feature
$ git merge master

or

$ git merge master feature

```
### Git Rebase
#### Definition 

_Rebase is another way to integrate changes from one branch to another. Rebase compresses all the changes into a single “patch.” Then it integrates the patch onto the target branch._
_Unlike merging, rebasing flattens the history because it transfers the completed work from one branch to another. In the process, unwanted history is eliminated._

#### How to use:
```
$ git checkout feature
$ git rebase master

```

_*Note: If you rebase incorrectly and unintentionally rewrite the history, it can lead to serious issues, so make sure you know what you are doing!_ 

### Git Flow
#### Setting Up git-flow in a Project
##### Install
```
$ brew install git-flow-avh
```
##### Initialize
```
git flow init
```

##### Starting a new feature
```
git flow feature start MYFEATURE
```

##### Finishing up a feature
```
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
```

##### Publish a feature
```
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
```

##### Getting a published feature
_Get a feature published by another user_
```
git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
```
_Track a feature on origin by using_

```
git flow feature track MYFEATURE

```
#### Make a release
 
##### Starting a release
_To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch._
```
git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]

```
_To publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers_

```
git flow release publish RELEASE
```
_Track a remote release_

```
git flow release track RELEASE
```
##### Finishing up a release

```
git flow release finish RELEASE
```
_push your tags with_

```
git push origin --tags
```
#### HotFixes

##### Start a HotFixes

```
git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]

```

##### Finish a HotFixes
