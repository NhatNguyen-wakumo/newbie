SQL Aliases – make your query shorter and more understandable.
INNER JOIN –  join concept and show you how to use the INNER JOIN clause to combine data from multiple tables.
LEFT OUTER JOIN – another kind of joins that allows you to combine data from multiple tables.
FULL OUTER JOIN – join multiple tables by including rows from both tables whether or not the rows have matching rows from another table.
CROSS JOIN – produce a Cartesian product of rows of the joined tables using the cross join operation.
SELF JOIN – join a table to itself using either the inner join or left join clause.
